          History
        </h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">
          Once known as Sitio Bubuyan, a farming area rich in rice, peanuts, and
          corn. After World War II, a proposal was made to elevate Sitio Bubuyan
          to an independent village due to its growing population. With
          community support and the backing of Lipa City officials, this vision
          became a reality. On June 22, 1960, through Republic Act 3590, Sitio
          Bubuyan was officially recognized as Barangay Sto. Ni√±o, named in
          honor of our patron. We celebrate our annual festival every January
          16th
