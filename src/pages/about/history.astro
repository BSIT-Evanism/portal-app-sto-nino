          HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE BARANGAY

            The History of Barangay Sto. Niño, Lipa City Barangay Sto. Niño,
            formerly known as Sitios Bubuyan and Bubuyanan, is located in Lipa
            City, Batangas. The name "Bubuyan" comes from the Tagalog word for
            "big," which describes the large size of the land. It was also
            referred to as "Bubuyanan," a name believed to have been derived
            from the numerous honeybees (bubuyanan in Tagalog) that once
            inhabited the area. The first settlers of Bubuyan were farmers who
            cultivated various crops like coconut, rice, and vegetables. They
            relied on a well-organized irrigation system fed by the nearby Bulo
            River.

          <p class="mb-6">
            The first leaders of the community were elected in 1960. They were
            given the title of "Teniente del Barrio" (village lieutenant) and
            were responsible for the community's welfare. On June 22, 1960, the
            barrio was officially established as Barangay Sto. Niño through
            Republic Act No. 3590. This was a significant milestone, as it
            recognized the community as an independent political entity with its
            own set of laws and leaders.

          <p class="mb-6">
            The new name, "Sto. Niño," was chosen to honor Santo Niño, or the
            Child Jesus, who is the patron saint of the barangay. A church
            dedicated to the Santo Niño was built in 1962, and a yearly fiesta
            is celebrated on the 16th of January in honor of the patron saint.
            The first elected officials of the barangay were also responsible
            for the construction of the barangay hall, a health center, and a
            school, which became the center of community life.

            The barangay has an area of 825.036 hectares and a population of
            3,528 people as of 2020. It is located near the Bulo River, which
            provides a source of water for the community. The barangay is also a
            major agricultural area, producing various crops like rice,
            vegetables, and fruits. The main industry is agriculture, with
            farming and animal raising as the primary sources of livelihood. The
            residents are also involved in cottage industries such as
            handicrafts and food processing. The barangay is also known for its
            local delicacies, such as bibingka, biko, and suman.
