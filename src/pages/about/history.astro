          HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE BARANGAY

          The History of Barangay Sto. Niño, Lipa City Barangay Sto. Niño,
          formerly known as Sitios Bubuyan and Bubuyanan, is located in Lipa
          City, Batangas. The name "Bubuyan" comes from the Tagalog word for
          "big," which describes the large size of the land. It was also
          referred to as "Bubuyanan," a name believed to have been derived from
          the numerous honeybees (bubuyanan in Tagalog) that once inhabited the
          area. The first settlers of Bubuyan were farmers who cultivated
          various crops like coconut, rice, and vegetables. They relied on a
          well-organized irrigation system fed by the nearby Bulo River. The
          first leaders of the community were elected in 1960. They were given
          the title of "Teniente del Barrio" (village lieutenant) and were
          responsible for the community's welfare. On June 22, 1960, the barrio
          was officially established as Barangay Sto. Niño through Republic Act
          No. 3590. This was a significant milestone, as it recognized the
          community as an independent political entity with its own set of laws
          and leaders. The new name, "Sto. Niño," was chosen to honor the Santo
          Niño, or the Child Jesus, who is the patron saint of the barangay. A
          church dedicated to the Santo Niño was built in 1962, and a yearly
          fiesta is celebrated on the 16th of January in honor of the patron
          saint. The first elected officials of the barangay were also
          responsible for the construction of the barangay hall, a health
          center, and a school, which became the center of community life. The
          barangay has an area of 825.036 hectares and a population of 3,528
          people as of 2020. It is located near the Bulo River, which provides a
          source of water for the community. The barangay is also a major
          agricultural area, producing various crops like rice, vegetables, and
          fruits. The main industry is agriculture, with farming and animal
          raising as the primary sources of livelihood. The residents are also
          involved in cottage industries such as handicrafts and food
          processing. The barangay is also known for its local delicacies, such
          as bibingka, biko, and suman.
