          The History of Barangay Sto. Niño, Lipa City Barangay Sto. Niño,
          formerly known as Sitios Bubuyan and Bubuyanan, is located in Lipa
          City, Batangas. The name "Bubuyan" comes from the Tagalog word for
          "big," which describes the large size of the land. It was also
          referred to as "Bubuyanan," a name believed to have been derived from
          the numerous honeybees (bubuyanan in Tagalog) that once inhabited the
          area.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first settlers of Bubuyan were farmers who cultivated various
          crops like coconut, rice, and vegetables. They relied on a
          well-organized irrigation system fed by the nearby Bulo River. The
          first leaders of the community were elected in 1960. They were given
          the title of "Teniente del Barrio" (village lieutenant) and were
          responsible for the community's welfare. On June 22, 1960, the barrio
          was officially established as Barangay Sto. Niño through Republic Act
          No. 3590. This was a significant milestone, as it recognized the
          community as an independent political entity with its own set of laws
          and leaders.
        </p>

        <p>
          The new name, "Sto. Niño," was chosen to honor the Santo Niño, or the
          Child Jesus, who is the patron saint of the barangay. A church
          dedicated to the Santo Niño was built in 1962, and a yearly fiesta is
          celebrated on the 16th of January in honor of the patron saint. The
          first elected officials of the barangay were also responsible for the
          construction of the barangay hall, a health center, and a school,
          which became the center of community life. The barangay has an area of
          825.036 hectares and a population of 3,528 people as of 2020. It is
          located near the Bulo River, which provides a source of water for the
          community. The barangay is also a major agricultural area, producing
          various crops like rice, vegetables, and fruits. The main industry is
          agriculture, with farming and animal raising as the primary sources of
          livelihood. The residents are also involved in cottage industries such
          as handicrafts and food processing. The barangay is also known for its
          local delicacies, such as bibingka, biko, and suman.
