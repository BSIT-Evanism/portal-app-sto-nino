        Once known as Sitio Bubuyan, a farming area rich in rice, peanuts, and
        corn, our community began to grow significantly after World War II. Due
        to its increasing population, a proposal was made to elevate it to an
        independent village. With strong community support and the backing of
        Lipa City officials, this vision became a reality. On June 22, 1960,
        through Republic Act 3590, Sitio Bubuyan was officially recognized as
        Barangay Sto. Ni√±o, named in honor of our patron. We celebrate our
        annual festival every January 16th.
