        History is the study of past events, particularly those concerning human
        societies, civilizations, and cultures. It involves the exploration and
        interpretation of records, artifacts, and narratives to understand how
        people lived, made decisions, and influenced the world over time.
        Through history, we gain insight into the development of societies, the
        causes and effects of major events, and the evolution of ideas,
        institutions, and technologies. It helps us learn from past successes
        and failures, shaping our identity and guiding future actions.
